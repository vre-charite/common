# common

Importable Pip package that generates entity ID and connects with Vault (secret engine) to retrieve credentials.

## Import package
Pip install command from GitLab:
```
pip install common --index-url https://__token__:<GITLAB_PAT>@git.indocresearch.org/api/v4/projects/158/packages/pypi/simple
```

Pip install command from `.whl` file:
```
pip install common-<VERSION>-py3-none-any.whl
```

In `requirements.txt`:
```
--index-url https://__token__:<GITLAB_PAT>@git.indocresearch.org/api/v4/projects/158/packages/pypi/simple
common
```

`<GITLAB_PAT>` is a GitLab personal access token with the `read_api` scope.

## Update package
Refer to documentation: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/pypi_repository/#publish-a-pypi-package-by-using-twine

1. Update the package version in `setup.py`. Otherwise, the push will fail with duplicate version number.

2. Install the python `build` and `twine` package:
```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade build
python3 -m pip install --upgrade twine
```

3. Build the common package:
```
python3 -m build
```

Now you will see two more folder generated under ./common/
```
|- common.egg-info/
|- dist/
```

4. Push to GitLab:
```
TWINE_PASSWORD=<PASS>  TWINE_USERNAME=<USER> python3 -m twine upload --repository-url https://git.indocresearch.org/api/v4/projects/158/packages/pypi dist/*
```
